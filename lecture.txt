CORS ==> cross origin resourse sharing
--> fronend
--> backend

=> cors allows you to define which client or frotend shold be able to request you .

cors({origin: 'https:notes.app.netify.com'}) ==> only localhost:3000 can request you
cors({ origin: '*' }) => any fronend can request you 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
planning for backend project====>
==> register and ligin system
==> user schema and model
==> while registering will be hashing the password
==> ehile login will comparing the password using bcrypt and create jwt token 

if want to use import/export like react ==> package.json => "type":"module"

noteModel :
title 
description
status

--> 3 kind of relationships==> 1 to 1, 1 to many and many to many
but in that case user is one and notes are many show we use
--> 1 to many relationship (notes are dependeble so store the user id in notes)
- user
- notes(user Id)
